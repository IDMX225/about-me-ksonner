                    I am currently in my 4th year of college. I started at Rutgers 
                    and changed my major from nursing to engineering and now my final
                    major is computer science. I will be graduating from RVCC in May 
                    and transfering to TCNJ to finsh my bachelors degree. After I finish 
                    my degree I hope to get a job as a full stack web developer.

                    <p>
                        CSS animations is an animation that gradually changes from one style to another. 
                        This is normally done using JavaScript but can also be done using CSS. The first 
                        thing to do is specify keyframes. Keyframes are rules the animation will follow 
                        when changing style. Another important factor to remember is setting an animation 
                        duration. This tells the animation hold long it will take to change, without this 
                        set duration the animation will not occur. Another to not about any animation is 
                        it will go back to the original color or location
                   </p>
                    <p>
                        There are many ways to create an animation, one of the ways is to create a shape 
                        and move it across the screen. To do this you will need to add coordinates of 
                        where you want you object to go. You can use “left” and “top” to choose the 
                        coordinates. For example, you can use “left:0px; top:0px;” as your starting 
                        point and then for each of the following locations  edit left and top to change 
                        the position of the object.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        You can also change the color of the object and there are a few ways to do this 
                        as well. You can change it from one color to another or have it fade through the 
                        rainbow. For fading from one color to another you need to use the key words “from” 
                        and “to” from being your initial color and to being your second color. When fading
                         through multiple colors you can use percentages. For example, if you want to fade 
                         through 5 colors each color will have a percent multiple of 25. 0%, 25%, 50%, 75%, 
                         and 100%. 0% is your initial color. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Other variations of code you can add is an animation delay, by setting the delay 
                        time; “animation-delay: -2s”. You can also set the number of times your animation 
                        will run by using “animation-iteration-count”. If you want your animation to run 
                        infinitely you change the iteration count from a set number to “infinite”, allowing 
                        your animation to run forever.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        There is also an “animation-timing-function” which specifies the curve of the 
                        animation. Linear keeps a constant speed from start to finish. Ease starts slow, 
                        moves fast, then ends slow. There is also ease-in and ease-out, they are the same 
                        but opposites. Ease-in starts slow and ends fast, while ease-out starts fast and ends slow. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        There is a shorthand for writing animation code making it easier to read and saves space. 
                        For example: You can write “animation-name: fadeInOut; animation-duration: 2.5s; animation-iteration-count: 2; 
                        animation-name: moveLeft300px; animation-duration: 5s; animation-iteration-count: 1; animation-name: bounce; 
                        animation-duration: 1s; animation-iteration-count: 5;” OR you can add all the names, duration and iteration 
                        counts to one line. It would look like this; animation-name: fadeInOut, moveLeft300px, bounce; animation-duration: 
                        2.5s, 5s, 1s; animation-iteration-count: 2, 1, 5;” This is also helpful when you have more than one animation style 
                        but the same duration or iteration count. Its easier to add all the styles to one name line and then have the 
                        duration and iteration count underneath it.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        There are many kinds of animations making the possibilities endless. You can create an 
                        envelope that opens revealing a letter when it to hovered over. You could create a 
                        secret message to appear when hovered over. You could code different animations for 
                        buttons, make then shake or glitch or pulse. You could code a button to flash the 
                        rainbow when you click on it. Adding animation to your website is one of the way to 
                        add a personal touch but also an interesting thing to look at while a viewer is on your site
